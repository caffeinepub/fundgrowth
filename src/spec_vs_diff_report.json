  "summary": "REQ-1 appears largely implemented via a new GoldOfferingsSection component containing the 5 specified offerings and imported into BondsPage. The diff evidence suggests it is placed below the bond catalog grid, and it uses non-emoji UI markers. Some added copy/UI (section title/description and a Premium badge) were not explicitly requested and may risk deviating from “exactly as provided” depending on interpretation.",

    {
      "description": "Adds a new section heading and marketing description text (“Gold-Backed Investment Plans” + descriptive paragraph) that were not requested as part of REQ-1 (which only specifies listing the offerings with exact names/detail strings).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not ask for additional title/description copy—only the 5 offerings with exact strings; extra copy could be considered beyond scope.",

      "reason": "REQ-1 only requires rendering the exact names and detail strings; an additional Premium badge is extra UI not requested and could be interpreted as altering the “exactly as provided” presentation.",
