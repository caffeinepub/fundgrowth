  "summary": "Implemented dynamic bond quick-access links in the site header for both desktop and mobile, sourced from the existing bond listings query and routed via TanStack Router params. Added constrained/scrollable UI for long bond lists. Also introduced unrelated global theme color token changes in index.css.",

    {
      "description": "Global theme color palette/token changes in `frontend/src/index.css` (OKLCH deep green/warm neutral/gold accent) unrelated to adding header bond quick links.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on adding bond quick links in the header; it does not request a global theme/palette update. This constitutes a UI redesign risk beyond what is required for navigation.",
